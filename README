This is a GstAVSynth port of the Decomb AviSynth filter.
It is based on original Decomb v5.2.3.

GstAVSynth is available here:

Original Decomb for AviSynth is available here:
http://neuron2.net/decomb/decombnew.html

To use Decomb (after you compile it) you'll need GStreamer itself and
GstAVSynth GStreamer plugin.

Decomb should (in theory) work on all platforms where GStreamer works. Decomb
is tested and works on Windows.

To build Decomb, use GNU Make with one of the makefiles:
    make -f Makefile.something
